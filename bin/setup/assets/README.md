# VC4PM Usage Guide

This directory contains the configuration for VC4PM (Vibe-Coding for PM), an MCP server that connects your AI assistant to your project management system (e.g., Notion).

## What is VC4PM?

VC4PM is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to create, update, and manage tasks on your behalf. It works seamlessly with AI-powered editors like Claude Code, Cursor, and others.

## Configuration Files

- **config.json**: Contains your workflow configuration and provider credentials (Notion, Linear, GitHub)
- **templates/**: Custom task and summary templates for your workflow

## Getting Started

### 1. Configure Your Provider

Edit `.vc4pm/config.json` and add your provider credentials:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "available": {
      "notion": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiKey": "your_notion_integration_token_here",
          "databaseId": "your_notion_database_id_here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Add MCP Server to Your Editor

The setup script should have configured this automatically. If not:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add vc4pm "vc4pm-server"
```

**Cursor / VS Code / Other editors:**
Add to your MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vc4pm": {
      "command": "vc4pm-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Use AI Tools Naturally

Once configured, your AI assistant will have access to task management tools:

- **create_task**: Create new tasks with workflow templates
- **get_task**: Retrieve task information
- **update_task**: Update task status, title, or type
- **execute_task**: Execute task workflow
- **read_notion_page**: Read Notion pages and linked content
- **analyze_todos**: Analyze task todos
- **update_todos**: Batch update todos
- **generate_summary**: Generate task summaries
- **get_task_template**: Get workflow templates
- **append_summary**: Add summaries to tasks

Simply ask your AI assistant to create or manage tasks using natural language!

## Troubleshooting

**Server not connecting:**
```bash
# Check if server is configured
claude mcp list

# The vc4pm server should show as "Connected"
```

**Tools not available:**
- Ensure you're in a project directory with `.vc4pm/config.json`
- Verify your provider credentials are correct
- Restart your AI editor
